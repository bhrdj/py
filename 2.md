# intro2py2024 Lesson 2

Steps for 2nd lesson:
1. Have them open their ipython
2. Demonstrate a forloop over chars in a string (review)
3. Assign some integers to vars and do some basic math.
```
floaters = 12
carers = 9
carers * 2
floaters
carers * 2 > floaters
carers * 2 - floaters
floaters_shortage = carers * 2 - floaters
```
4. Check Steven's Github
    - Type the following URL into the address bar. Then click on "1.md"
```
github.com/bhrdj/py
```
    - Click on the "copy" links to copy-paste, then create two new tabs and paste these URLs into the address bar.
```
github.com
```
```
github.com/bhrdj
```
    - Discuss briefly the importance of git and github/bitbucket/codecommit, etc.
5. Use variables in reports with f-strings
```
report = f"""
We have {n_floaters} shoes and {n_carers} staff.
We are short by {floaters_shortage} shoes.
But...
...we remain unsure about sizes and L/R foot sides!
"""
```
5. Open multiple tabs in terminal, and use shortcut keys:
CTRL+T,
CTRL+W,
CTRL+TAB,
CTRL+SHIFT+TAB
6. More math and forloops and f-strings
```
wallet = 8000
salary = 1000
foodcost = 400
print(wallet)
for day in 'mtwrf':
    wallet = wallet + salary
    wallet = wallet - foodcost
    print(f'Leo ni {day} jioni. Nina {wallet} shillingi.')
```
